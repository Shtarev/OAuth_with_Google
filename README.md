# # OAuth registration with Google
---
1. **Make a Project, the Client ID and Client secret keys, and the redirect address here: https://console.cloud .google.com/apis**

## Initial installation (for example and refinement):
It only works live (not locally)

2. **Clone the repository to the root https://yousite.com:**
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client.git ./

3. **Start composer**
composer install

4. **Copy two files from the repository to the root config.php and redirect.php and enter your data in them - Client ID and Client secret, and the redirect address.**

5. **Go to https://yousite.com/redirect.php **
- ...at the end, you will receive the data, use it for registration as you want...
